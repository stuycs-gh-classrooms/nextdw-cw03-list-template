## Linked List Fun!
In this repository you will find the Processing program __SpringListCW__. It contains a driver file and multiple classes, all of which should look familiar to you at this point. First thing you should do is look at the driver file and read the comments at the top.

## Task 0:
Modify code in the driver, and `OrbList.pde` files to add node selection, in the way we have been discussing in class. The `Orb` class has an already complete `isSelected(x, y)` method, as well as a `lineSize` instance variable.

## Task 1:
Modify `OrbNode` so that we will also see a line going from any `OrbNode` to its `previous` node (if one exists). This line should be black, and you should be able to see both the lines to `next` and `previous` at the same time.

## Task 2:
Modify code in the driver, and `OrbList.pde` so that when a node is selected, and `i` is pressed, a new node is added after the selected node.

## Task 3:
Modify code in the driver, and `OrbList.pde` so that when the right mouse button is pressed, and the mouse is over a node, that node is removed.
